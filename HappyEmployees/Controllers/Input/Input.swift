// Here I modified the contract (returning an optional) because we cannot use a unified protocol for the file and url 
// based resource loading. We need to return a location based on the contract. When a file is missing someone has to 
// handle the error. The class implementing this protocol is responsible of handling it. This could be done by throwing 
// and error or returning an optional.
